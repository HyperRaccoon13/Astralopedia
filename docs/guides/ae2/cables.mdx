Cables are main component of network, as they are responsible for connecting devices and carrying channels.  
There are several parameters for each channel: density, type and color.

## Density

Density is one of most important parameters, as it is what defines amount of channels.  
All normal cables carry up to 8 channels, while dense cables carry up to 32 channels.

## Type

Type of cable is mostly aesthetic parameter. Smart cables, however, have special functionality: they will show amount of channels used in it as lighted up lines on its sides.

## Color

Colored cables only connect to shimmer (uncolored) cables or cables of same color.

## Cable anchors

Cable anchors can be used to prevent cables from connecting to each other; useful for managing subnetworks or decorating.

## Quartz fiber

Quartz fiber allows to pass energy from one cable to another without connecting networks.
