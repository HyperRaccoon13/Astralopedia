# Getting Started with AE2

Applied Energistics 2 (also known as AE2 or simply AE) is mod that allows people to create storage networks, also known as ME networks (often called AE networks for simplicity).  
It also adds means of autocrafting as well as its own kind of storage, item cells (and fluid cells for liquid materials).  
You can also check [original AE2 wiki](https://guide.appliedenergistics.org/1.18/getting-started).
